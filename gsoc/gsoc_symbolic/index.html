There are two forms of identifiability analysis: structural and practical. Structural identifiability analysis relates changes in the solution of the ODE directly to other parameters, showcasing that it is impossible to distinguish between parameter A being higher and parameter B being lower, or the vice versa situation, given only data about the solution because of how the two interact. This could be done directly on the symbolic form of the equation as part of <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a>. Meanwhile, practical identifiability analysis looks as to whether the parameters are non-identifiable in a practical sense, for example if two parameters are numerically indistinguishable &#40;given possibly noisy data&#41;. In this case, numerical techniques being built in DiffEqSensitivity.jl, such as a <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqSensitivity.jl/issues/109">nonlinear likelihood profiler</a> or an <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqSensitivity.jl/issues/108">information sensitivity measure</a> can be used to showcase whether a parameter has a unique enough effect to be determined.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: A basic background in differential equations and the ability to use numerical ODE solver libraries.

There are well established methods to calculate what these coefficients should be given the activation energy of a reaction.

GalacticOptim.jl adds a few high-level features, such as integrating with automatic differentiation, to make its usage fairly simple for most cases, while allowing all of the options in a single unified interface. Currently ModelingToolkit.jl is provided as one of the AD backend options and can also be used to define the optimization problem symbolically directly. Thsi support is currently limited and doesn&#39;t cover things like constraints yet, but there is tremendous value to be gained by leveraging symbolic simplification possible with ModelingToolkit. This project would also cover integrating into MathOptInterface to by using the symbolic expressions generated from MTK, in addition to the current MOI wrapper available in GalacticOptim.</p> <p><strong>Recommended Skills</strong>: Background knowledge of standard machine learning, statistical, or optimization techniques.
