While we have mechanistic models of lots of different scientific phenomena, and reams of data being generated from experiments - our computational capabilities are unable to keep up. Our problems are too large for realistic simulation. Our problems are multiscale and too stiff. Our problems require tedious work like calculating gradients and getting code to run on GPUs and supercomputers. Our next step forward is a combination of science and machine learning, which combines mechanistic models with data based reasoning, presented as a unified set of abstractions and a high performance implementation. We refer to this as scientific machine learning.</p> <p><a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1478744">Scientific Machine Learning, abbreviated SciML, has been taking the academic world by storm as an interesting blend of traditional scientific mechanistic modeling &#40;differential equations&#41; with machine learning methodologies like deep learning.</a> While traditional deep learning methodologies have had difficulties with scientific issues like stiffness, interpretability, and enforcing physical constraints, this blend with numerical analysis and differential equations has evolved into a field of research with new methods, architectures, and algorithms which overcome these problems while adding the data-driven automatic learning features of modern deep learning. Many successes have already been found, with tools like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125">physics-informed neural networks</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385">universal differential equations</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007&#37;2Fs40304-017-0117-6">deep BSDE solvers for high dimensional PDEs</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08055.pdf">neural surrogates</a> showcasing how deep learning can greatly improve scientific modeling practice. At the same time, researchers are quickly finding that our training techniques will need to be modified in order to work on difficult scientific models. For example the original method of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10298">reversing an ODE for an adjoint or relying on backpropagation through the solver is not numerically stable for neural ODEs</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04536">traditional optimizers made for machine learning, like Stochastic Gradient Descent and ADAM have difficulties handling the ill-conditioned Hessians of physics-informed neural networks</a>. New software will be required in order to accommodate the unique numerical difficulties that occur in this field, and facilitate the connection between scientific simulators and scientific machine learning training loops.</p> <p>SciML is an open source software organization for the development and maintenance of a feature-filled and high performance set of tooling for scientific machine learning. This includes the full gamut of tools from differential equation solvers to scientific simulators and tools for automatically discovering scientific models. What I want to do with this post is introduce the organization by explaining a few things:</p> <ul> <li><p>What SciML provides</p> <li><p>What our goals are</p> <li><p>Our next steps</p> <li><p>How you can join in the process</p> </ul> <h1 id=the_software_that_sciml_provides ><a href="#the_software_that_sciml_provides" class=header-anchor >The Software that SciML Provides</a></h1> <h2 id=we_provide_best-in-class_tooling_for_solving_differential_equations ><a href="#we_provide_best-in-class_tooling_for_solving_differential_equations" class=header-anchor >We provide best-in-class tooling for solving differential equations</a></h2> <p>We will continue to have <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/">DifferentialEquations.jl</a> at the core of the organization to support high performance solving of the differential equations that show up in scientific models. This means we plan to continue the research and development in:</p> <ul> <li><p>Discrete equations &#40;function maps, discrete stochastic &#40;Gillespie/Markov&#41; simulations&#41;</p> <li><p>Ordinary differential equations &#40;ODEs&#41;</p> <li><p>Split and partitioned ODEs &#40;Symplectic integrators, IMEX Methods&#41;</p> <li><p>Stochastic ordinary differential equations &#40;SODEs or SDEs&#41;</p> <li><p>Random differential equations &#40;RODEs or RDEs&#41;</p> <li><p>Differential algebraic equations &#40;DAEs&#41;</p> <li><p>Delay differential equations &#40;DDEs&#41;</p> <li><p>Mixed discrete and continuous equations &#40;Hybrid Equations, Jump Diffusions&#41;</p> <li><p>&#40;Stochastic&#41; partial differential equations &#40;&#40;S&#41;PDEs&#41; &#40;with both finite difference and finite element methods&#41;</p> </ul> <p>along with continuing to push towards new domains, like stochastic delay differential equations, fractional differential equations, and beyond. However, optimal control, &#40;Bayesian&#41; parameter estimation, and automated model discovery all require every possible bit of performance, and thus we will continue to add functionality that improves the performance for solving both large and small differential equation models. This includes features like:</p> <ul> <li><p>GPU acceleration through CUDAnative.jl and CuArrays.jl</p> <li><p>Automated sparsity detection with <a href="https://github.com/SciML/SparsityDetection.jl">SparsityDetection.jl</a></p> <li><p>Automatic Jacobian coloring with <a href="https://github.com/SciML/SparseDiffTools.jl">SparseDiffTools.jl</a>, allowing for fast solutions to problems with sparse or structured &#40;Tridiagonal, Banded, BlockBanded, etc.&#41; Jacobians</p> <li><p>Progress meter integration with the Juno IDE for estimated time to solution</p> <li><p><a href="https://diffeq.SciML.ai/dev/features/ensemble/">Automatic distributed, multithreaded, and GPU parallelism of ensemble trajectories</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://diffeq.SciML.ai/dev/analysis/sensitivity/">Forward and adjoint local sensitivity analysis</a> for fast gradient computations</p> <li><p>Built-in interpolations for differential equation solutions</p> <li><p>Wrappers for common C/Fortran methods like Sundials and Hairer&#39;s radau</p> <li><p>Arbitrary precision with BigFloats and Arbfloats</p> <li><p>Arbitrary array types, allowing the solution of differential equations on matrices and distributed arrays</p> </ul> <p>We plan to continue our research into these topics and make sure our software is best in class. We plan to keep improving the performance of DifferentialEquations.jl until it is best-in-class in every benchmark we have, and then we plan to add more benchmarks to find more behaviors and handle those as well. Here is a current benchmark showcasing native DifferentialEquations.jl methods outperforming classical Fortran methods like LSODA by 5x on a 20 equation stiff ODE benchmark:</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1814174/77687352-a0082800-6f74-11ea-924d-442a0836be6d.PNG" alt="" /></p> <p><a href="https://benchmarks.sciml.ai/html/StiffODE/Pollution.html">Reference: Pollution Model Benchmarks</a></p> <h2 id=we_provide_tools_for_deriving_and_fitting_scientific_models ><a href="#we_provide_tools_for_deriving_and_fitting_scientific_models" class=header-anchor >We provide tools for deriving and fitting scientific models</a></h2> <p>It is very rare that someone thinks their model is perfect. Thus a large portion of the focus of our organization is to help scientific modelers derive equations and fit models. This includes tools for:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/analysis/parameter_estimation/">Maximum likelihood and Bayesian parameter estimation</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/analysis/sensitivity/">Forward and adjoint local sensitivity analysis</a> for fast gradients</p> <li><p><a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/analysis/global_sensitivity/">Global sensitivity analysis</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://surrogates.sciml.ai/latest/">Building surrogates of models</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/analysis/uncertainty_quantification/">Uncertainty quantification</a></p> </ul> <p>Some of our newer tooling like <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DataDrivenDiffEq.jl">DataDrivenDiffEq.jl</a> can even take in timeseries data and generate LaTeX code for the best fitting model &#40;for a recent demonstration, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NxFOtpNHl7oXpdSLM06TEN_oO8QylPYx/view">this fitting of a COVID-19 epidemic model</a>&#41;.</p> <p>We note that while these tools will continue to be tested with differential equation models, many of these tools apply to scientific models in general. For example, while our global sensitivity analysis tools have been documented in the differential equation solver, these methods actually work on any function <code>f&#40;p&#41;</code>:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs"><span class=hljs-keyword >using</span> QuasiMonteCarlo, DiffEqSensitivity

A physicist, biologist, chemist, etc. should be able to pick up our tools and make use of high performance scientific machine learning methods without requiring the understanding of every component and using abstractions that make sense to their field. To make this a reality, we provide high-level domain-specific modeling tools as frontends for building and generating models.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqBiological.jl">DiffEqBiological.jl</a> is a prime example which generates high performance simulations from a description of the chemical reactions.

This means we plan to enforce coding styles that are compatible with language-wide differentiable programming tools like <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl">Zygote</a>, or provide pre-defined forward/adjoint rules via the derivative rule package <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ChainRules.jl">ChainRules.jl</a>.</p> <p>As demonstrated in the following animation, you can take our stochastic differential equation solvers and train a circuit to control the solution by simply piecing together compatible packages.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1814174/51399524-2c6abf80-1b14-11e9-96ae-0192f7debd03.gif" alt="" /></p> <h2 id=performance_is_considered_a_priority_and_performance_issues_are_considered_bugs ><a href="#performance_is_considered_a_priority_and_performance_issues_are_considered_bugs" class=header-anchor >Performance is considered a priority, and performance issues are considered bugs</a></h2> <p>No questions asked. If you can find something else that is performing better, we consider that an issue and should get it fixed. High performance is required for scientific machine learning to scale, and so we take performance seriously.</p> <h2 id=our_packages_are_routinely_and_robustly_tested_with_the_tools_for_both_scientific_simulation_and_machine_learning ><a href="#our_packages_are_routinely_and_robustly_tested_with_the_tools_for_both_scientific_simulation_and_machine_learning" class=header-anchor >Our packages are routinely and robustly tested with the tools for both scientific simulation and machine learning</a></h2> <p>This means we will continue to develop tools like <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl">DiffEqFlux.jl</a> which supports the connection between the <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/">DifferentialEquations.jl</a> differential equation solvers and the <a href="https://fluxml.ai/">Flux</a> deep learning library. Another example includes our <a href="https://surrogates.sciml.ai/dev/">surrogate modeling library, Surrogates.jl</a> which is routinely tested with DifferentialEquations.jl and the machine learning AD tooling like Zygote.jl, meaning that you can be sure that our surrogates modeling tools can train on differential equations and then be used inside of deep learning stacks. It is this interconnectivity that will allow next-generation SciML methodologies to get productionized in a way that will impact &quot;big science&quot; and industrial use.</p> <h2 id=we_keep_up_with_advances_in_computational_hardware_to_ensure_compatibility_with_the_latest_high_performance_computing_tools ><a href="#we_keep_up_with_advances_in_computational_hardware_to_ensure_compatibility_with_the_latest_high_performance_computing_tools" class=header-anchor >We keep up with advances in computational hardware to ensure compatibility with the latest high performance computing tools.</a></h2> <p>Today, Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs are the dominant platforms, but that won&#39;t always be the case. <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15581/el-capitan-supercomputer-detailed-amd-cpus-gpus-2-exaflops">One of the upcoming top supercomputers will be entirely AMD-based, with AMD CPUs and AMD GPUs</a>. In addition, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/15120/intels-2021-exascale-vision-in-aurora-two-sapphire-rapids-cpus-with-six-ponte-vecchio-gpus">Intel GPUs</a> are scheduled to be a component in future supercomputers. We are committed to maintaining a SciML toolchain that works on all major platforms, updating our compiler backends as new technology is released.</p> <h1 id=our_next_steps ><a href="#our_next_steps" class=header-anchor >Our Next Steps</a></h1> <p>To further facilitate our focus to SciML, the next steps that we are looking at are the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>We will continue to advance differential equation solving in many different directions, such as adding support for stochastic delay differential equations and improving our methods for DAEs.</p> <li><p>We plan to create a new documentation setup. Instead of having everything inside of the <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/">DifferentialEquations.jl documentation</a>, we plan to split out some of the SciML tools to their own complete documentation. We have already done this for <a href="https://surrogates.sciml.ai/latest/">Surrogates.jl</a>. Next on the list is <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl">DiffEqFlux.jl</a> which by looking at the README should be clear is in need of its own full docs. Following that we plan to fully document <a href="https://github.com/SciML/NeuralPDE.jl">NeuralPDE.jl</a> and its Physics-Informed Neural Networks &#40;PINN&#41; functionality, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DataDrivenDiffEq.jl">DataDrivenDiffEq.jl</a>, etc. Because it does not require differential equations, we plan to split out the documentation of <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/analysis/global_sensitivity/">Global Sensitivity Analysis</a> to better facilitate its wider usage.</p> <li><p>We plan to continue improving the <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit</a> ecosystem utilizing its symbolic nature for <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl/issues/469">generic specification of PDEs</a>. This would then be used as a backend with Auto-ML as an automated way to solve any PDE with Physics-Informed Neural Networks.</p> <li><p>We plan to continue benchmarking everything, and improve our setup to include automatic updates to the benchmarks for better performance regression tracking. We plan to continue adding to our benchmarks, including benchmarks with MPI and GPUs.</p> <li><p>We plan to improve the installation of the Python and R side tooling, making it automatically download precompiled Julia binaries so that way users can utilize the tooling just by using CRAN or pip to install the package. We plan to extend our Python and R offerings to include our neural network infused software like DiffEqFlux and NeuralPDE.</p> <li><p>We plan to get feature-completeness in data driven modeling techniques like <a href="https://surrogates.sciml.ai/latest/">Radial Basis Function &#40;RBF&#41; surrogates</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DataDrivenDiffEq.jl">Dynamic Mode Decomposition and SInDy type methods</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">Model Order Reduction</a>.</p> <li><p>We plan to stay tightly coupled to the latest techniques in SciML, implementing new physically-constrained neural architectures, optimizers, etc. as they are developed.</p> </ul> <h1 id=how_you_can_join_in_the_process ><a href="#how_you_can_join_in_the_process" class=header-anchor >How You Can Join in the Process</a></h1> <p>If you want to be a part of SciML, that&#39;s great, you&#39;re in&#33; Here are some things you can start doing:</p> <ul> <li><p>Star our libraries like <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>.
