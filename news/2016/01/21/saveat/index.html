This latest tag, v0.5, adds compatibility with the latest Julia v0.6 nightly &#40;similar changes have been added to many solvers like StochasticDiffEq.jl on master, but have not yet been tagged&#41;.</p> <p>But the main changes of this update are bug fixes to saveat and improved Rosenbrock methods. There was a bug in <code>saveat</code> such that for large changes in <code>dt</code> there could be oscillations in the output. Also, errors would occur if values of <code>saveat</code> matched <code>tstops</code>. Both of these bugs have been fixed, and <code>saveat</code> should work properly with all combinations of <code>tstops</code>, <code>save_timeseries</code>, and <code>dense</code>, letting you mix and match the behavior.</p> <p>In addition, the <code>Rosenbrock23</code> and <code>Rosenbrock32</code> methods have received some updates. There have been some minor performance improvements, but more importantly the Rosenbrock methods now have a &quot;stiff-safe&quot; interpolant. Before it had used the standard 3rd order Hermite interpolation, which &quot;in theory&quot; since it&#39;s order 3 was &quot;good enough&quot;, but in reality for really stiff equations this showed oscillations. A new interpolation has been placed on this method which utilizes the internal steps to not oscillate &#40;and have less error&#41; on stiff equations, making these Rosenbrock methods now a very good general method for stiff equations with dense &#40;continuous&#41; output.</p> <p>Coming soon are even more improvements to performance for these methods, &#40;finally&#41; the ability to pass arbitrary linear solvers, and full usage of the &quot;Performance Overloads&quot;. In addition, I am working on getting these working with more types &#40;Unitful types, complex numbers, changing size problems&#41;. Once these Rosenbrock methods are fully optimized and integrated with this extra functionality, I&#39;ll be implementing higher order Rosenbrock methods in the same manner. This should give a really complete story for stiff equations, with the LSODA, Sundials, and DASSL available for BDF methods.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > Website powered by <a href="https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl">Franklin.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a> programming language. </div> </div> </div>
